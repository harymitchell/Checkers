#SUMMARY

The goal of this module is to have a node.js checkers server which allows anyone to challange the computer to play.  While the computer generates random moves for now. The goal is to eventually implement a some kind of learning algorithm.

#DEVELOPMENT
1. Needs more testing of move generation and validation, as this is very buggy!
2. Implement double jumps.
3. Teach computer to prefer jump moves.
